    <string name="About1">We at BookStat are working to create the best experience for local
        buying and selling online.

        We developed this app because we were fed up with online marketplaces that are hard to
        browse, charge expensive listing fees, and are full of spammers and fakes. We wanted to
        create a simple, secure environment where buyers and sellers can easily trade goods from the
        palm of their hand. Using the power of your mobile phone, this app has made selling as
        simple as taking a selfie and buying as easy as commenting on one. And free for everyone to
        use.
    </string>

    <string name="About2">Snap a photo, enter a short description, and be selling to thousands
        of potential buyers within seconds. And making an offer is as quick and easy as sending a
        text message.
